## uni-projects
This repo contains various projects developed during my studies.

- **image-processing**: The main goal of this project was to process an image of a game, so that the photographed game can be continued on the computer using the game state shown in the picture.

- **lisp-machine**: The main goal of this project was to build a lisp machine in hardware (programming an FPGA using VHDL).

- **performance-evaluation**: The main goal of this project was to build a framework that assists a user in assessing the performance of an application.

- **LLVM-Translation-Tool**: This project was developed within my master thesis. The project translates OpenMP code to MPI in order to allow for an execution on distributed memory systems. Based on my contribution, the development of this project will continue. This project is managed by [Jannek Squar](https://wr.informatik.uni-hamburg.de/people/jannek_squar).
